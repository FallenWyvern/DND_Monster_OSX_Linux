# DnD-Monster-Generator
Monster Generation Tool for Dungeons and Dragons 5e

The creator of this tool as well as this tool has no connection or affiliation with the official Dungeons and Dragons trademark
or with that of Wizards of the Coast or Hasbro.

The software is incomplete and as such is provided as is.

Current Features:
Ability to create monsters for 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons.
Ability to export those monsters as an image, HTML page or send to any Printer.
Save/Load created monsters.
Edit existing abilities.

Requested features
- Linux/Mac port (currently screenshots are done via DLLImports, meaning windows only.
- Auto-Calculating CR. This will probably not be able to make it in due to the complexity of parsing user entered abilities.
- SVG output. This will be a much later feature, as that requires an entirely different renderer.
- OneNote output. This is a maybe, provided I can get my hands on OneNote and find the time to learn it.
